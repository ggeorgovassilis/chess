# Chess
An experimental chess programme written in Java, for no particular reason. It doesn't do much yet other than
drawing an (ASCII) board with pieces and validating basic moves.

# Compiling
Compile the src directory with JDK8 - the only dependency is JUnit and that's optional.

# Running
Once compiled run as
> java -cp bin chess.Chess

You might want to use an UTF-8 console.
